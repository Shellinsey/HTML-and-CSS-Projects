		<p class="p">There are many wonderful spots in the Pacific Northwest.  My girls and I love to check out 
		new places.  We do like the water and water sports so we usually choose a lake, reservior, or a river.</p>
		<p>The list that I have contructed is a place either I have stayed or I really want to stay.</p>
	
		<!--First spot-->
			<div class="first_spot">
			<img src="./images/Eagle_Creek_Trailhead.jpg" alt="Eagle Creek Trailhead">
			<p>Camp site is thru the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area. A free permit 
			is required by backpackers.</p>
			</div>
		<!--Second spot-->
			<div class="second_spot">
			<img src="./images/Silver_Falls.jpg" alt="Silver Falls">
			<p>I have personally camped at Silver Falls outside of Salem, Oregon. It was 
			beautiful and clean.  Horseback riding is offered down the road.</p>
			</div>
		<!--Third spot-->
			<div class="third-spot">
			<img src="./images/Ice_Cap_Creek_Campground.jpg" alt="Ice Cap Creek Campground">
			<p>I have not been to Ice Cap Creek Campground.  It looks absolutely beautiful.  That is the 
			next spot on my list</p>
			</div>
		<!--Fourth spot-->
			<div>
			<img src="./images/Lower_Falls_Lewis_River.jpg" alt="Lower Falls Lewis River">
			<p>This place is breathtaking.  Lewis River runs a little cold, but if you go around August you are in for 
			a treat.  It has clean and crystal clear water.</p>
